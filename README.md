# passwordGen
Created a prompt to ask the user how many characters they would like their password to be. Set parameters to ensure the password is between 8-128 characters.

Created variables with a confirm message to ask users if they would like to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters in their password, with an alert that makes sure they select at least one.

Created variables that listed all possible values for each character type.

Created if statements to use character types if their confirm is "true".
